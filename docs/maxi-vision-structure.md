## Vision Creation Flow (From Screenshots)

### Step 1: Material Desires (6-12 months)
**Prompt**: "List material desires here for the next 6-12 months. If there are no limitations in your imagination and therefore no limitations in reality. Paint a clear picture in your mind. Make the descriptions specific and add a definite date for when you would like to be in possession of each desire. Do NOT limit yourself."

**Key Points:**
- 6-12 month timeframe
- No limitations thinking
- Specific descriptions
- Definite dates
- "Do NOT limit yourself"

### Step 2: Life Purpose
**Prompt**: "How does aurora intend to make the world a better place? In other words, If there was only 1 thing aurora could do to make the world a better place, what would it be? Simplify to 2-3 sentences."

"Remember, write in the third person just like you're writing your own article in Forbes about YOU..."

**Example**: "aurora is building a transformational mindset app that helps millions of people improve their lives."

**Fallback**: If you don't know what your purpose is, simply write, "aurora is becoming increasingly clear every day."

- Write in 3rd person
- Forbes article style
- 2-3 sentences

What is it about this person that you love? Perhaps it's tough to pick one personâ€¦ Pick and choose the qualities of the people you admire the most."

## Key Implementation Notes

### Language Style:
1. **Third person** (always "aurora", never "I")
2. **Present tense** ("is becoming", not "will become")
3. **"More and more" language** for believability
4. **Specific and measurable** goals with dates
5. **Forbes article style** - aspirational but believable

### Vision Components to Store:
```javascript
{
  materialDesires: [{ text: "...", date: "2025-12-31" }],

}
```
